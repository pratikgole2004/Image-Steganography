# Digital Image Steganography

## Description
This web application allows users to securely embed text messages within images using AES encryption. The project features a user-friendly interface built with React.js for encoding and decoding operations, and a Node.js backend to handle image processing and encryption. The application also includes password protection for added security of the hidden messages.

## Features
- **AES Encryption**: Securely embeds and retrieves messages using AES encryption.
- **Password Protection**: Ensure only authorized users can retrieve hidden messages with password authentication.
- **React.js Frontend**: An intuitive and responsive frontend for uploading images, entering messages, and performing secure encoding/decoding operations.
- **Node.js Backend**: A backend built with Express to handle image processing, AES encryption, and decryption efficiently.
- **File Handling**: Uses Multer for handling file uploads and Sharp for image manipulation.
- **Responsive Design**: User interface designed for a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
